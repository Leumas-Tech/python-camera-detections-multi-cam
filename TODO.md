# TODO

This is a list of features and improvements that can be added to the camera detection system.

## Features

*   [ ] **Asynchronous Camera Discovery:** Implement a non-blocking method to discover camera sources to prevent the UI from freezing.
*   [ ] **Dynamic Profile Updates:** Allow users to update and save changes to existing profiles.
*   [ ] **Advanced Camera Configuration:** Add options to configure camera properties like resolution, frame rate, and exposure.
*   [ ] **Custom Model Selection:** Allow users to select different YOLOv8 models or even custom-trained models.
*   [ ] **Detection Analytics:** Add a dashboard to display detection statistics, such as object counts and frequency.
*   [ ] **Event Logging:** Implement a logging system to record detection events and system errors.
*   [ ] **Remote Access:** Add a web interface or API to view camera streams and detection results remotely.

## Improvements

*   [ ] **Code Refactoring:** Refactor the code to improve modularity and readability.
*   [ ] **Error Handling:** Implement more robust error handling to gracefully manage camera disconnections and other exceptions.
*   [ ] **Performance Optimization:** Optimize the frame processing pipeline to reduce latency and improve performance.
*   [ ] **UI Enhancements:** Improve the user interface to make it more intuitive and user-friendly.
*   [ ] **Testing:** Add unit and integration tests to ensure the stability and reliability of the application.
